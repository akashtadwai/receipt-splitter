🧾 Making split bills magical with Claude \& Mistral AI ✨

## Motivation

My motivation was simple: I wanted to test the cleverness of Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by Claude's feat of converting a 27-year-old EXE file into Python ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1iyumpf/i_uploaded_a_27yearold_exe_file_to_claude_37_and/)) and the groundbreaking AI-written paper accepted at ICLR ([Sakana AI](https://sakana.ai/ai-scientist-first-publication/)), I decided to explore LLM APIs. Despite my limited knowledge of React, Tailwind, and FastAPI, I built this app with about 90% of the code generated by Claude & Mistral AI in under 6 hours!

## What It Does 🤔

Ever been stuck at dinner trying to figure out who owes what? Receipt Splitter makes splitting bills with friends hassle-free! This app:

- 📸 **Snaps a pic** of your receipt and magically extracts all the items and prices
- 🔍 **Recognizes** what you ordered and how much it cost
- ✏️ **Lets you fix** anything the AI might have missed
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Divides expenses fairly** by letting you assign specific items to specific people
- 💸 **Handles discounts** whether it's a percentage off or a fixed amount
- 🧮 **Adds taxes and tips** evenly across everyone
- 📊 **Shows exactly** what each person owes

## How to Run Locally 🏠

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- Python (v3.8+)
- A Mistral AI API key - [Get one here](https://console.mistral.ai/)


### Frontend Setup 🖥️

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/akashtadwai/receipt-splitter.git
cd receipt-splitter

# Install frontend dependencies
cd receipt-splitter-frontend
npm install

# Start the frontend development server
npm start
```

The frontend will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Backend Setup 🔧

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd receipt-splitter-backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file with your Mistral API key
echo "MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env

# Start the backend server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The backend API will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Testing 🧪

To run the backend tests:

```bash
cd receipt-splitter-backend
pytest
```
To run the frontend tests:

```bash
cd receipt-splitter-frontend
npm test -- --watchAll=false
```


## Technologies Used 💻

- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS for that slick look
- **Backend**: FastAPI - because Python deserves speed too!
- **OCR Magic**: Powered by Mistral AI
- **Hosting**: Render (free tier FTW!)
