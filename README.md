🧾 Making split bills magical with Claude \& Mistral AI ✨

## What It Does 🤔

Ever been stuck at dinner trying to figure out who owes what? Receipt Splitter makes splitting bills with friends hassle-free! This app:

- 📸 **Snaps a pic** of your receipt and magically extracts all the items and prices
- 🔍 **Recognizes** what you ordered and how much it cost
- ✏️ **Lets you fix** anything the AI might have missed
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Divides expenses fairly** by letting you assign specific items to specific people
- 💸 **Handles discounts** whether it's a percentage off or a fixed amount
- 🧮 **Adds taxes and tips** evenly across everyone
- 📊 **Shows exactly** what each person owes


## Motivation 🧪🤖🔬

My motivation was simple - I wanted to see if LLMs are actually as clever as everyone says they are! 🤯 And wow, they definitely are! 🚀 Despite having limited knowledge of React, Tailwind, and FastAPI, I managed to build this entire app with about 90% of the code generated by Claude \& Mistral AI in less than 6 hours from start to finish. Consider my mind blown! 🧠💥

## How to Run Locally 🏠

### Prerequisites
