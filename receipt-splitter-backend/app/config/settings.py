    "1. Items section must contain product purchases only with their FINAL prices (not MRP)\n"
    "2. The final total_bill should be the actual amount paid by the customer\n"
    "3. CRITICAL RULES FOR TAXES AND DISCOUNTS:\n"
    "   - EXCLUDE ALL line items marked as 'FREE', 'Zero', '0', or 'â‚¹0'\n"
    "   - EXCLUDE ALL 'Product discount', 'MRP discount' items - these are already factored into item prices\n"
    "   - EXCLUDE delivery charges or any other fees with zero value\n"
    "   - ONLY include fees, charges, and taxes that have a non-zero monetary value AND are charged on top of item prices\n"
    "   - For Blinkit/grocery receipts, only include 'Handling charge' if it has a non-zero value\n"
    "4. IMPORTANT - taxes array should ONLY include:\n"
    "   - Service charges, handling fees, delivery fees (ONLY if they have a positive non-zero value)\n"
    "   - Tax items like GST, VAT, service tax (ONLY if they have a positive non-zero value)\n"
    "   - Final bill discounts (NOT product/MRP discounts) (ONLY if they have a negative non-zero value)\n"
    "5. ALWAYS EXCLUDE from taxes:\n"
    "   - ANY item with value of 0 or marked as FREE\n"
    "   - MRP (Maximum Retail Price) information\n"
    "   - 'Product discount' or any discount showing the difference between MRP and selling price\n" 
    "   - Item totals / subtotals\n"
    "   - Any line that summarizes the order\n"
    "6. Format all monetary values as plain numbers without currency symbols\n"
    "7. Handle + and - correctly (e.g., discount of 45 should be -45.0)\n\n"
